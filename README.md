# Descriptive Statistics with Python Project
Descriptive Statistics is the subject matter of this project. Descriptive statistics gives us the basic summary measures about the dataset. The summary measures include measures of central tendency (mean, median and mode) and measures of variability (variance, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values, IQR (Interquartile Range), skewness and kurtosis). I have used the fortune 500 dataset from the data world website for this project.

# Distribution Analysis

The salary distribution is positively skewed, indicating that there are a few high salaries that are affecting the mean.

The skewness of the salary data is 25.4968, which is significantly greater than 1, indicating a highly skewed distribution.

The kurtosis is 775.3650, suggesting a leptokurtic distribution, meaning the data has a higher peak and fatter tails compared to a normal distribution.

# Outliers

The analysis indicates the presence of outliers in the salary data, particularly among high salaries, which can distort the overall statistics.

# Role and Location Insights

The most frequent job title in the dataset is Data Scientist, and the most common location is Bangalore.

The dataset includes 2528 unique companies and 25 unique job titles.

# Conclusions

The salary data for data professionals in 2022 shows a significant variation, with a few high salaries skewing the average.

The presence of outliers suggests that while most salaries are within a certain range, there are exceptional cases that should be considered separately.

The findings highlight the importance of considering both the mean and median when analyzing salary data, as the mean can be heavily influenced by outliers.

Future analyses could focus on segmenting the data by job title or location to provide more granular insights into salary distributions across different roles and regions.
